My name is Justin. I am from Illinois and I have started coding this year (2022). 
I currently know JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
I was on the path to becoming a PTA (Physical Therapy Assistant), and even finished the PTA program out of LakeLand College, but decided that was not for me. 
I got into coding through a friend of mine while I was at the PTA program and have been enjoying it ever sense.
